## Skills

#### Communication

I honed my communication abilities during my previous expereince at Santander, where I held a customer-facing role addressing fraud inquiries on the phone. As my responsibilities evolved within the company, I found myself communicating the intricate fraud issues faced by our customers to an external team not directly engaged with our customers. To streamline this process, I used the complex customer inquiries and concised into a comprehensive reports, enabling the back-office team to promptly assess the information for the customer. My adept communication skills eventually led me to take on a mentoring and coaching role for new hires at the company, where the practice of providing constructive feedback became second nature to me.

During, my bootcamp jounrey the feedback experiences helped enhance my learning expereince, and I ran extra session for the morning peer group to talk about weekly challenegers and blockers with suggestiongs on workflow or solutions.


#### Analytic skills

I developed my analytic skills during my tenure as a Money Laundering Investigator at Monzo. In this role, I was responsible for meticulously examining customer account information, spanning from bank transactions to personal details, with the objective of determining whether an account was operating within legal parameters. This process often required delving into months' worth of transactional data, coupled with supplementary information, in order to construct a comprehensive profile of the customer. This in-depth analysis was critical for me to form a clear understanding of how the customer was utilizing the bank's services, enabling me to make informed decisions regarding the account's compliance with legal requirements or terms and services of the bank.

#### Agile

I am currently working on a game as a side project, purely for the enjoyment it brings. This experience brought back the significance of operating within an agile environment. It has proven to be pivotal for my workflow, as it involves breaking down complex problems into more manageable, bite-sized tasks. This approach not only makes the project feel more achievable but also enhances my overall engagement and productivity. For example brought to mind my experience with the final project at Makers. In that situation, we faced a challenge with two team members being unavailable for a couple of days during the two weeks. To maintain our workflow and better teamwork, we made a deliberate decision to focus on smaller tasks and streamline the project's scope. This adjustment proved instrumental in keeping the projects scope compeletable for the time frame we had left.

Moreover, I have taken the initiative to document this project's journey through devlogs. These logs serve as a record of the trial-and-error process, showcasing the evolution and challenges encountered along the way.
